Analysis:
  This was a study on Capomulin and its effectiveness in comparison to the other nine anti-tumor drugs. Our findings conclude that Capomulin had similar results as Ramicane. This would include similar mean,	median,	variance,	and standard deviation results. Ramicane did however outperform Capomulin by a few tenths of a point in each catagory. This is impressive as Ramicane out performed all the other drugs.
